    <h2>Natural Heritage</h2>
    <p>
	 As Punekars, we are extremely lucky to have the Sahyadri range surrounding us. Apart from immense natural beauty, the Sahyadris is home to a number of forts that make for perfect weekend trekking destinations.

Not only are these treks a fun and exciting way to keep up with our fitness regimes, but they also treat us to stunning views AND let us go back in time as we explore these magnificent old structures.
